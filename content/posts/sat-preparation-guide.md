The SAT consists of two main sections:
- **Reading and Writing**: 65 minutes for Reading, 35 minutes for Writing and Language
- **Math**: 25 minutes (no calculator) + 55 minutes (calculator)
- **Optional Essay** (discontinued in 2021, but some schools may still require it)

### Scoring

- **Total Score**: 400-1600 (combining Reading/Writing and Math sections)

- Take your first full-length practice test under timed conditions
- Review your practice test to understand error patterns

### 4-6 Months Before Test Day

**Focus on Weak Areas**
- Dedicate extra time to your lowest-scoring sections
- Continue taking practice tests every 2-3 weeks
- Begin timed section practice for better pacing

### 2-3 Months Before Test Day

### Final Month

**Fine-Tune Your Skills**

## Study Strategies That Work

### 1. Use Official Practice Tests

The College Board offers 8 free official practice tests. These are the most accurate representation of the actual SAT. Use them under strict timed conditions.

### 2. Review Every Mistake

Don't just identify wrong answers - understand why the correct answer is right and why your choice was wrong. This prevents repeated mistakes.

### 3. Build Stamina

The SAT is a marathon, not a sprint. Practice with full-length tests to build the endurance needed for test day.

### 4. Master Time Management

Each section has a time limit:
- Reading: ~1 minute 15 seconds per question
- Writing: ~45 seconds per question
- Math (no calculator): 75 seconds per question
- Math (calculator): 87 seconds per question

Practice pacing to ensure you can complete all questions.

### 5. Focus on Your Weakest Section First

In your final month of preparation, dedicate 60-70% of study time to your lowest-scoring section. Small improvements here have the biggest impact on your total score.

## Free SAT Resources

- **Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy**: Free personalized practice based on your PSAT scores
- **College Board Daily Practice App**: Daily questions delivered to your phone
- **Official SAT Study Guide**: 8 full-length practice tests
- **Library Books**: Many public libraries have SAT prep books you can borrow

## Test Day Tips

### What to Bring

1. **Admissions Ticket** printed from your College Board account
2. **Photo ID** (driver's license, school ID, passport, or state ID)
3. **No. 2 pencils** (mechanical pencils are not allowed)
4. **Approved Calculator** for the Math section
5. **Snacks and water** for break time

### What NOT to Bring

- Mobile phones, smartwatches, or any electronic devices
- Books, notes, or highlighters
- Mechanical pencils
- Rulers or protractors
- Any type of noise-canceling headphones

### During the Test

- Read instructions carefully before starting each section
- Skip difficult questions and return to them if time permits
- Fill in bubbles carefully - stray marks can affect your score
- Use strategies like process of elimination
- Stay calm and focused

## Common SAT Myths Debunked

**Myth 1**: You should guess on every question
**Reality**: Since there's no penalty for wrong answers, you should never leave a question blank.

**Myth 2**: You need to memorize vocabulary for the Reading section
**Reality**: Vocabulary is tested in context. Focus on understanding passages rather than memorizing word lists.

**Myth 3**: You can't improve your score significantly
**Reality**: Most students see improvement of 100-200 points with proper preparation.

**Myth 4**: Test day scoring is different from practice tests
**Reality**: Scoring is completely standardized. The key is maintaining similar conditions during practice.

## When to Retake the SAT

Consider retaking the SAT if:

- Your score is below your target range by more than 100 points
- You've had more time to study (at least 2-3 months)
- You experienced technical difficulties or illness on test day
- You've significantly improved in your weak areas

Remember: You can take the SAT as many times as you want, but most students see diminishing returns after 3-4 attempts.

## Final Thoughts

Success on the SAT comes from consistent preparation over time, not last-minute cramming. Start early, stay focused, and use high-quality practice materials. Remember that the SAT is just one part of your college application - strong grades, extracurriculars, and essays are equally important.
